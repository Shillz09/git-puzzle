What is a cowsay with a hash?

this:
```

\ a                                       /
 -----------------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
handy notes:
  * vim has a cool encryption feature
  * git show <commit-id> is useful
  * git log --oneline shows git commits in a consistent way. You can do fun things to limit the commits you see in the log.
  * Any output from the fortune command in this repo is the sole opinion of the cow or whatever animal is uttering the fortune. In most cases, it was chosen at random and never filtered for content. The offensive fortunes file was not used as a source, so don't be offended.
